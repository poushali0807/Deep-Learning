# DL Lab 1 - Single Layer Perceptron for Binary Classification

## Overview

This experiment focuses on implementing a Single Layer Perceptron from scratch for binary classification. The model is trained using the Banknote Authentication Dataset and demonstrates how a perceptron learns by updating its weights and bias based on classification errors. Various visualizations are generated to study the learning behaviour and evaluate model performance.
